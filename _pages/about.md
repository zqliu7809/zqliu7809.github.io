I am a graduate student in UC Merced, department of Mechanical engineering, supervised by Prof.[Min Hwan Lee](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mlee49/).

My academic interest is to synthesis and characterization of carbon-based transition metal nanomaterials with certain 2D/3D nanostructures for the improvement of electrocatalytic performance applied in fuel cell.

I got my master’s degree on material science in [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), USA and earned my bachelor’s degree on materials chemistry in [Qingdao Univ. of Sci.&Tech](https://www.qust.edu.cn/), China.
